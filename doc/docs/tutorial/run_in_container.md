## Run IFLearner in the container
We can use containerization technology to run IFLearner in Docker and Jupyterlab.

### Docker
Docker is a package of Linux containers that provides an easy-to-use container interface. It is currently the most popular Linux container solution.

Docker packages the application and the program's dependencies in a single file. Running this file will generate a virtual container. Programs run in this virtual container as if they were running on a real physical machine. With Docker, you don't have to worry about the environment.

**You can find some of our examples and tutorials in iflearner project's ./enviroment/docker directory.**

### Jupyterlab
JupyterLab is Jupyter's latest data science production tool, and in a sense, it appeared to replace Jupyter Notebook. But don't worry that Jupyter Notebook will disappear, JupyterLab includes all the features of Jupyter Notebook.

JupyterLab is a web-based integrated development environment, you can use it to write notebooks, operate terminals, edit markdown text, open interactive mode, view csv files and pictures and other functions.
